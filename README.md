# SnowBOARD
This open-source prototyping module streamlines embedded system development by eliminating soldering and complex wiring requirements. The module features dedicated connectors and ports that enable plug-and-play peripheral connections through simple socket interfaces, dramatically reducing setup time and complexity.

Key features include an integrated SD card slot for data storage, a comprehensive battery power management circuit for portable applications, a USB Type-C interface for modern connectivity, and a built-in USB-to-UART converter that simplifies debugging and firmware uploads. This design approach makes embedded prototyping more accessible while maintaining professional-grade functionality for developers at all skill levels.
