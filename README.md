# SnowBOARD

I built this open source pcb to be a better alternative for simple boards like Arduino. Existing development boards require soldering and wiring for connecting peripherals, but this development board eliminates soldering. I designed dedicated connectors and ports to allow connecting peripherals with only a socket required with minimal wiring and no soldering. I also added sd card slot, battery power management circuit and type-c usb interface. There is a usb to uart converter which allows uploading firmware via usb cable using the Arduino IDE.
